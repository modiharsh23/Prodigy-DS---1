# Prodigy InfoTech Internship: Data Analysis Insights

Welcome to the Prodigy InfoTech Internship repository! This repository documents are for Task 1 of my internship journey, focusing on data cleaning, analysis, and uncovering insightful patterns.
# Task 1

Create a bar chart or histogramto visualiza the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable,such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.
# Extracting Top 10 Countries by Total Population

The data was filtered to include only rows where the 'Series Code' is 'SP.POP.TOTL', which represents the total population.
The filtered data was then sorted by population in descending order, allowing the identification of the top 10 countries with the highest total population.
